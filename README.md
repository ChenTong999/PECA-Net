###Abstract: The CNN-Transforerm hybrid methods have shown promising performance in medical image segmentation, due to the collaboration of global dependencies and local context. However, the self-attention operation with quadratic complexity models global correlations within individual samples, which is problematic for 3D image segmentation. To address this issue, we propose PECA-Net integrating external attention with convolution for volumetric medical image segmentation. Initially, paired external attention capturing the relationships
